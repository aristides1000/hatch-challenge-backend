## About

The main goals for this exercise are:

- Implement a connection between a Ruby on Rails back-end and ReactJS front-end.
- Understand the pros and cons of different approaches of connecting Ruby on Rails back-end with ReactJS front-end.
- Take a scheduling challenge imposed by the hatch company.

In this project, only the Ruby on Rails back-end part was implemented. The front-end part of the project can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/aristides1000/hatch-challenge-frontend).

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- RSpec
- PostgreSQL
- JWT
- Cloudinary
- VisualStudio Code, Git, & GitHub

## Pre-requisites

- Ruby (v. 3.0.1)
- Rails (v. 6.1.4)
- NodeJs (v. 14.17)
- YarnJs (v. 1.22.10)
- PostgreSQL (v. 12.8)
- Git

## Getting Started

1. In your terminal, in the folder of your preference, type the following bash command to clone this repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:aristides1000/hatch-challenge-backend.git
```

2. Now that you have already cloned the repo run the following commands to get the project up and running:

```sh
cd hatch-challenge-backend
bundle
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

3. Now, on your terminal, run:

```sh
rails server
```

This should start your local server in [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Now, you can open the REST API client of your choice (Thunder Client extension for VScode is recommended) to fetch the data from the API.

To stop the server, hit `<CTRL> + C` on your keyboard.

You can also find an API-consumer built with ReactJS in [this repo](https://github.com/aristides1000/hatch-challenge-frontend) that will display the front-end side application.
